## Setup

We will use Python along with JupyterLab for the course tutorials and projects. JupyterLab is an interactive development environment for working on or sharing live code, text, and visualizations. It is especially popular in data science and scientific computing.

While JupyterLab can be separately installed, you are advised to install Anaconda for convenience. Anaconda is a free application for package and environment management. It comes with Python, some major Python packages, and environments such as JupyterLab while also enabling us to easily switch between different Python environments or install and maintain Python packages.

Please follow these steps:
1. Find the suitable Anaconda installer and download it from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
1. Read [the documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) and setup Anaconda on your computer.
    * You can watch [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/30oXSTTF9p8?t=106) for Windows.
    * You can watch [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/2JeoNlCcLOM?t=14) for macOS.
    * You can watch [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFswV4J2ZEs&feature=&t=22) for Linux.
1. If you already had Python and an existing IDE installed, you experience that things get complicated for whatever reason, and you know what you are doing, you may want to remove Anaconda and install JupyterLab separately. Check [this page](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).
1. Once you launch Anaconda Navigator, you can browse different applications from the home tab and launch JupyterLab. Launching it should open the application on your web browser.
1. Watch these videos and you are ready to go:
